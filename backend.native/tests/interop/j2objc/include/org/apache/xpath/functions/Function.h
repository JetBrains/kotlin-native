 @brief This is a superclass of all XPath functions.This allows two
  ways for the class to be called.
 One method is that the
  super class processes the arguments and hands the results to
  the derived class, the other method is that the derived
  class may process it's own arguments, which is faster since
  the arguments don't have to be added to an array, but causes
  a larger code footprint.
