 @brief A rate limiter.Conceptually, a rate limiter distributes permits at a configurable rate.
 Each 
 <code>acquire()</code> blocks if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. Once
  acquired, permits need not be released. 
 <p><code>RateLimiter</code> is safe for concurrent use: It will restrict the total rate of calls from
  all threads. Note, however, that it does not guarantee fairness. 
 <p>Rate limiters are often used to restrict the rate at which some physical or logical resource
  is accessed. This is in contrast to <code>java.util.concurrent.Semaphore</code> which restricts the
  number of concurrent accesses instead of the rate (note though that concurrency and rate are
  closely related, e.g. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little's
  Law</a>).
  
 <p>A <code>RateLimiter</code> is defined primarily by the rate at which permits are issued. Absent
  additional configuration, permits will be distributed at a fixed rate, defined in terms of
  permits per second. Permits will be distributed smoothly, with the delay between individual
  permits being adjusted to ensure that the configured rate is maintained. 
 <p>It is possible to configure a <code>RateLimiter</code> to have a warmup period during which time
  the permits issued each second steadily increases until it hits the stable rate. 
 <p>As an example, imagine that we have a list of tasks to execute, but we don't want to submit
  more than 2 per second: 
 @code
 final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(2.0); // rate is "2 permits per second"
  void submitTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, Executor executor) {
    for (Runnable task : tasks) {
      rateLimiter.acquire(); // may wait
      executor.execute(task);
    }  }  
 
@endcode
  
 <p>As another example, imagine that we produce a stream of data, and we want to cap it at 5kb per
  second. This could be accomplished by requiring a permit per byte, and specifying a rate of 5000
  permits per second: 
 @code
 final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(5000.0); // rate = 5000 permits per second
  void submitPacket(byte[] packet) {
    rateLimiter.acquire(packet.length);
    networkService.send(packet);
  } 
 
@endcode
  
 <p>It is important to note that the number of permits requested <i>never</i> affects the
  throttling of the request itself (an invocation to <code>acquire(1)</code> and an invocation to <code>acquire(1000)</code>
  will result in exactly the same throttling, if any), but it affects the throttling
  of the <i>next</i> request. I.e., if an expensive task arrives at an idle RateLimiter, it will be
  granted immediately, but it is the <i>next</i> request that will experience extra throttling,
  thus paying for the cost of the expensive task.
