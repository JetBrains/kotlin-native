 @brief A readable source of characters, such as a text file.Unlike a <code>Reader</code>, a <code>CharSource</code>
  is not an open, stateful stream of characters that can be read and closed.
 Instead,
  it is an immutable <i>supplier</i> of <code>Reader</code> instances. 
 <p><code>CharSource</code> provides two kinds of methods: 
 <ul>
    <li><b>Methods that return a reader:</b> These methods should return a <i>new</i>, independent
        instance each time they are called. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the
        returned reader is closed.   
 <li><b>Convenience methods:</b> These are implementations of common operations that are
        typically implemented by opening a reader using one of the methods in the first category,
        doing something and finally closing the reader that was opened. 
 </ul>
  
 <p>Several methods in this class, such as <code>readLines()</code>, break the contents of the source
  into lines. Like <code>BufferedReader</code>, these methods break lines on any of <code>\n</code>, <code>\r</code>
  or <code>\r\n</code>, do not include the line separator in each line and do not consider there to
  be an empty line at the end if the contents are terminated with a line separator. 
 <p>Any <code>ByteSource</code> containing text encoded with a specific character
  encoding
  may be viewed as a <code>CharSource</code> using <code>ByteSource.asCharSource(Charset)</code>.
