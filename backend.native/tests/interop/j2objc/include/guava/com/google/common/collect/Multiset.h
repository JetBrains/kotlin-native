/*!
 @brief A collection that supports order-independent equality, like <code>Set</code>, but may have duplicate
  elements.A multiset is also sometimes called a <i>bag</i>.
 <p>Elements of a multiset that are equal to one another are referred to as <i>occurrences</i> of
  the same single element. The total number of occurrences of an element in a multiset is called the 
 <i>count</i> of that element (the terms "frequency" and "multiplicity" are equivalent, but
  not used in this API). Since the count of an element is represented as an <code>int</code>, a multiset
  may never contain more than <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> occurrences of any one element. 
 <p><code>Multiset</code> refines the specifications of several methods from <code>Collection</code>. It
  also defines an additional query operation, <code>count</code>, which returns the count of an
  element. There are five new bulk-modification operations, for example <code>add(Object, int)</code>,
  to add or remove multiple occurrences of an element at once, or to set the count of an element to
  a specific value. These modification operations are optional, but implementations which support
  the standard collection operations <code>add(Object)</code> or <code>remove(Object)</code> are encouraged
  to implement the related methods as well. Finally, two collection views are provided: <code>elementSet</code>
  contains the distinct elements of the multiset "with duplicates collapsed", and 
 <code>entrySet</code> is similar but contains <code>Multiset.Entry</code> instances, each providing
  both a distinct element and the count of that element. 
 <p>In addition to these required methods, implementations of <code>Multiset</code> are expected to
  provide two <code>static</code> creation methods: <code>create()</code>, returning an empty multiset, and 
 <code>create(Iterable<? extends E>)</code>, returning a multiset containing the given initial
  elements. This is simply a refinement of <code>Collection</code>'s constructor recommendations,
  reflecting the new developments of Java 5. 
 <p>As with other collection types, the modification operations are optional, and should throw 
 <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> when they are not implemented. Most implementations should
  support either all add operations or none of them, all removal operations or none of them, and if
  and only if all of these are supported, the <code>setCount</code> methods as well. 
 <p>A multiset uses <code>Object.equals</code> to determine whether two instances should be considered
  "the same," <i>unless specified otherwise</i> by the implementation. 
 <p>Common implementations include <code>ImmutableMultiset</code>, <code>HashMultiset</code>, and <code>ConcurrentHashMultiset</code>
 .
  
 <p>If your values may be zero, negative, or outside the range of an int, you may wish to use 
 <code>com.google.common.util.concurrent.AtomicLongMap</code> instead. Note, however, that unlike 
 <code>Multiset</code>, <code>AtomicLongMap</code> does not automatically remove zeros. 
 <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained#multiset">
  <code>Multiset</code>
 </a>.
