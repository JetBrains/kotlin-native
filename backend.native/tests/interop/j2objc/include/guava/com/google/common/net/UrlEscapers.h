 @brief Returns an <code>Escaper</code> instance that escapes strings so they can be safely included in <a href="https://goo.gl/MplK6I">
 URL form parameter names and values</a>.Escaping is performed
  with the UTF-8 character encoding.
 The caller is responsible for <a href="https://goo.gl/9EfkM1">
 replacing any unpaired carriage return or line feed characters
  with a CR+LF pair</a> on any non-file inputs before escaping them with this escaper. 
 <p>When escaping a String, the following rules apply: 
 <ul>
    <li>The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain
        the same.   
 <li>The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
    <li>The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+".
    <li>All other characters are converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding and each
        byte is then represented by the 3-character string "%XY", where "XY" is the two-digit,
        uppercase, hexadecimal representation of the byte value. 
 </ul>
  
 <p>This escaper is suitable for escaping parameter names and values even when <a href="https://goo.gl/utn6M">
 using the non-standard semicolon</a>, rather than the ampersand, as
  a parameter delimiter. Nevertheless, we recommend using the ampersand unless you must
  interoperate with systems that require semicolons. 
 <p><b>Note:</b> Unlike other escapers, URL escapers produce <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode">
 uppercase</a> hexadecimal sequences.

 @brief Returns an <code>Escaper</code> instance that escapes strings so they can be safely included in <a href="https://goo.gl/m2MIf0">
 URL path segments</a>.The returned escaper escapes all non-ASCII
  characters, even though <a href="https://goo.gl/e7E0In">many of these are accepted in modern
  URLs</a>.
 (<a href="https://goo.gl/jfVxXW">If the escaper were to leave these characters
  unescaped, they would be escaped by the consumer at parse time, anyway.</a>) Additionally, the
  escaper escapes the slash character ("/"). While slashes are acceptable in URL paths, they are
  considered by the specification to be separators between "path segments." This implies that, if
  you wish for your path to contain slashes, you must escape each segment separately and then
  join them.
