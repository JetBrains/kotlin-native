 @brief An interface for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">
 graph</a>-structured data,
  whose edges are anonymous entities with no identity or information of their own.
 <p>A graph is composed of a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting pairs of nodes. 
 <p>There are three primary interfaces provided to represent graphs. In order of increasing
  complexity they are: <code>Graph</code>, <code>ValueGraph</code>, and <code>Network</code>. You should generally
  prefer the simplest interface that satisfies your use case. See the <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#choosing-the-right-graph-type">
  "Choosing the right graph type"</a> section of the Guava User Guide for more details. 
 <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  
 <p><code>Graph</code> supports the following use cases (<a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#definitions">
 definitions of
  terms</a>):
  
 <ul>
    <li>directed graphs
    <li>undirected graphs
    <li>graphs that do/don't allow self-loops
    <li>graphs whose nodes/edges are insertion-ordered, sorted, or unordered 
 </ul>
  
 <p><code>Graph</code> explicitly does not support parallel edges, and forbids implementations or
  extensions with parallel edges. If you need parallel edges, use <code>Network</code>.
  
 <h3>Building a <code>Graph</code></h3>
  
 <p>The implementation classes that <code>common.graph</code> provides are not public, by design. To
  create an instance of one of the built-in implementations of <code>Graph</code>, use the <code>GraphBuilder</code>
  class: 
 @code
 MutableGraph<Integer> graph = GraphBuilder.undirected().build(); 
 
@endcode
  
 <p><code>GraphBuilder.build()</code> returns an instance of <code>MutableGraph</code>, which is a subtype
  of <code>Graph</code> that provides methods for adding and removing nodes and edges. If you do not
  need to mutate a graph (e.g. if you write a method than runs a read-only algorithm on the graph),
  you should use the non-mutating <code>Graph</code> interface, or an <code>ImmutableGraph</code>.
  
 <p>You can create an immutable copy of an existing <code>Graph</code> using <code>ImmutableGraph.copyOf(Graph)</code>
 :
  
 @code
 ImmutableGraph<Integer> immutableGraph = ImmutableGraph.copyOf(graph); 
 
@endcode
  
 <p>Instances of <code>ImmutableGraph</code> do not implement <code>MutableGraph</code> (obviously!) and are
  contractually guaranteed to be unmodifiable and thread-safe. 
 <p>The Guava User Guide has <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#building-graph-instances">
 more
  information on (and examples of) building graphs</a>.
  
 <h3>Additional documentation</h3>
  
 <p>See the Guava User Guide for the <code>common.graph</code> package (<a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained">
 "Graphs Explained"</a>) for
  additional documentation, including: 
 <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#equals-hashcode-and-graph-equivalence">
        <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code>, and graph equivalence</a>
