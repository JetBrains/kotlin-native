 @brief A functional interface for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">
 graph</a>-structured data.
 <p>This interface is meant to be used as the type of a parameter to graph algorithms (such as
  topological sort) that only need a way of accessing the predecessors of a node in a graph. 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
  Given an algorithm, for example: 
 @code
 public <N> someGraphAlgorithm(N startNode, PredecessorsFunction<N> predecessorsFunction); 
 
@endcode
  you will invoke it depending on the graph representation you're using. 
 <p>If you have an instance of one of the primary <code>common.graph</code> types (<code>Graph</code>,
  <code>ValueGraph</code>, and <code>Network</code>):
  
 @code
 someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, graph); 
 
@endcode
  This works because those types each implement <code>PredecessorsFunction</code>. It will also work
  with any other implementation of this interface. 
 <p>If you have your own graph implementation based around a custom node type <code>MyNode</code>,
  which has a method <code>getParents()</code> that retrieves its predecessors in a graph: 
 @code
 someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, MyNode::getParents); 
 
@endcode
  
 <p>If you have some other mechanism for returning the predecessors of a node, or one that doesn't
  return a <code>Iterable<? extends N></code>, then you can use a lambda to perform a more general
  transformation: 
 @code
 someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, node -> ImmutableList.of(node.mother(), node.father())); 
 
@endcode
  
 <p>Graph algorithms that need additional capabilities (accessing both predecessors and
  successors, iterating over the edges, etc.) should declare their input to be of a type that
  provides those capabilities, such as <code>Graph</code>, <code>ValueGraph</code>, or <code>Network</code>.
  
 <h3>Additional documentation</h3>
  
 <p>See the Guava User Guide for the <code>common.graph</code> package (<a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained">
 "Graphs Explained"</a>) for
  additional documentation, including <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#notes-for-implementors">
 notes for
  implementors</a>

 @brief Returns all nodes in this graph adjacent to <code>node</code> which can be reached by traversing 
 <code>node</code>'s incoming edges <i>against</i> the direction (if any) of the edge.
 <p>Some algorithms that operate on a <code>PredecessorsFunction</code> may produce undesired results
  if the returned <code>Iterable</code> contains duplicate elements. Implementations of such
  algorithms should document their behavior in the presence of duplicates. 
 <p>The elements of the returned <code>Iterable</code> must each be:
