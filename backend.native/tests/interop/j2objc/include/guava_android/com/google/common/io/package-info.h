/*!
 @brief This package contains utility methods and classes for working with Java I/O; for example input
  streams, output streams, readers, writers, and files.
 <p>At the core of this package are the Source/Sink types: <code>ByteSource</code>
 , <code>CharSource</code>, <code>ByteSink</code>
  and <code>CharSink</code>. They
  are factories for I/O streams that provide many convenience methods that handle both opening and
  closing streams for you. 
 <p>This package is a part of the open-source <a href="http://github.com/google/guava">Guava</a>
  library. For more information on Sources and Sinks as well as other features of this package, see 
 <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/IOExplained">I/O Explained</a> on the Guava wiki.
