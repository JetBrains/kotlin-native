/*!
 @brief A builder for constructing instances of <code>MutableGraph</code> with user-defined properties.
 <p>A graph built by this class will have the following properties by default: 
 <ul>
    <li>does not allow self-loops
    <li>orders <code>Graph.nodes()</code> in the order in which the elements were added 
 </ul>
  
 <p>Example of use: 
 @code
 MutableGraph<String> graph = GraphBuilder.undirected().allowsSelfLoops(true).build();
  graph.putEdge("bread", "bread");
  graph.putEdge("chocolate", "peanut butter");
  graph.putEdge("peanut butter", "jelly");
