 @brief An object that can traverse the nodes that are reachable from a specified (set of) start node(s)
  using a specified <code>SuccessorsFunction</code>.
 <p>There are two entry points for creating a <code>Traverser</code>: <code>forTree(SuccessorsFunction)</code>
  and <code>forGraph(SuccessorsFunction)</code>. You should choose one
  based on your answers to the following questions: 
 <ol>
    <li>Is there only one path to any node that's reachable from any start node? (If so, the
        graph to be traversed is a tree or forest even if it is a subgraph of a graph which is
        neither.)   
 <li>Are the node objects' implementations of <code>equals()</code>/<code>hashCode()</code> <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#non-recursiveness">
 recursive</a>?
  </ol>
  
 <p>If your answers are: 
 <ul>
    <li>(1) "no" and (2) "no", use <code>forGraph(SuccessorsFunction)</code>.
    <li>(1) "yes" and (2) "yes", use <code>forTree(SuccessorsFunction)</code>.
    <li>(1) "yes" and (2) "no", you can use either, but <code>forTree()</code> will be more efficient.
    <li>(1) "no" and (2) "yes", <b><i>neither will work</i></b>, but if you transform your node
        objects into a non-recursive form, you can use <code>forGraph()</code>.

    <li>While traversing, the traverser will use <i>O(n)</i> space (where <i>n</i> is the number

/*!
 @brief Creates a new traverser for a directed acyclic graph that has at most one path from the start
  node(s) to any node reachable from the start node(s), and has no paths from any start node to
  any other start node, such as a tree or forest.
 <p><code>forTree()</code> is especially useful (versus <code>forGraph()</code>) in cases where the data
  structure being traversed is, in addition to being a tree/forest, also defined <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#non-recursiveness">
 recursively</a>.
  This is because the <code>forTree()</code>-based implementations don't keep track of visited nodes,
  and therefore don't need to call `equals()` or `hashCode()` on the node objects; this saves
  both time and space versus traversing the same graph using <code>forGraph()</code>.
  
 <p>Providing a graph to be traversed for which there is more than one path from the start
  node(s) to any node may lead to: 
 <ul>
    <li>Traversal not terminating (if the graph has cycles)
    <li>Nodes being visited multiple times (if multiple paths exist from any start node to any
        node reachable from any start node) 
 </ul>
  
 <p><b>Performance notes</b>
  
 <ul>
    <li>Traversals require <i>O(n)</i> time (where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes reachable from
        the start node).   
 <li>While traversing, the traverser will use <i>O(H)</i> space (where <i>H</i> is the number
        of nodes that have been seen but not yet visited, that is, the "horizon"). 
 </ul>
  
 <p><b>Examples</b> (all edges are directed facing downwards) 
 <p>The graph below would be valid input with start nodes of <code>a, f, c</code>. However, if <code>b</code>
  were <i>also</i> a start node, then there would be multiple paths to reach <code>e</code> and 
 <code>h</code>.
  
 @code
   a     b      c
    / \   / \     |
   /   \ /   \    |
  d     e     f   g
        |       |
        h
