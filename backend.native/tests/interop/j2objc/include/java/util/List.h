/*!
 @brief An ordered collection (also known as a <i>sequence</i>).The user of this
  interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
  inserted.
 The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
  the list), and search for elements in the list.<p>
  Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
  lists typically allow pairs of elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt>
  such that <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt>, and they typically allow multiple
  null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
  that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
  throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
  expect this usage to be rare.<p>
  The <tt>List</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
  specified in the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of the 
 <tt>iterator</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and 
 <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
  also included here for convenience.<p>
  The <tt>List</tt> interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
  access to list elements.  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note
  that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
  for some implementations (the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class, for
  example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
  preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
  implementation.<p>
  The <tt>List</tt> interface provides a special iterator, called a 
 <tt>ListIterator</tt>, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
  bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the 
 <tt>Iterator</tt> interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
  list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.<p>
  The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to search for a specified
  object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
  caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear
  searches.<p>
  The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
  remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.<p>
  Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,
  extreme caution is advised: the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>
  methods are no longer well defined on such a list. 
 <p>Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
  they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
  and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
  add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically 
 <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
  to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
  or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
  behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
  operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
  the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
  exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
  Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
  interface. 
 <p>This interface is a member of the

  This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of

  a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view

  removes a range of elements from a list:
