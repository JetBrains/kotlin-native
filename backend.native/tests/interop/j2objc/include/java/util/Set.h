/*!
 @brief A collection that contains no duplicate elements.More formally, sets
  contain no pair of elements <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> such that 
 <code>e1.equals(e2)</code>, and at most one null element.
 As implied by
  its name, this interface models the mathematical <i>set</i> abstraction. 
 <p>The <tt>Set</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
  inherited from the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of all
  constructors and on the contracts of the <tt>add</tt>, <tt>equals</tt> and 
 <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
  also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
  declarations have been tailored to the <tt>Set</tt> interface, but they do
  not contain any additional stipulations.) 
 <p>The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
  that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
  (as defined above). 
 <p>Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
  elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
  is changed in a manner that affects <tt>equals</tt> comparisons while the
  object is an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is
  that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element. 
 <p>Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
  they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
  and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
  add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically 
 <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
  to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
  or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
  behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
  operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
  the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
  exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
  Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
  interface. 
 <p>This interface is a member of the

 @brief Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the

 If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
