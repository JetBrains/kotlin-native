/*!
 @brief An engine that performs match operations on a <code></code>character sequence<code></code>
  by interpreting a <code>Pattern</code>.
 <p> A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's <code>matcher</code>
  method.  Once created, a matcher can be used to
  perform three different kinds of match operations: 
 <ul>
    <li><p> The <code>matches</code> method attempts to match the entire
    input sequence against the pattern.  </p></li>
    <li><p> The <code>lookingAt</code> method attempts to match the
    input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.  </p></li>
    <li><p> The <code>find</code> method scans the input sequence looking for
    the next subsequence that matches the pattern.  </p></li>
  
 </ul>
  
 <p> Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
  More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
  state of the matcher. 
 <p> A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the 
 <i>region</i>. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
  The region can be modified via the<code>region</code> method and queried
  via the <code>regionStart</code> and <code>regionEnd</code>
  methods. The way that the region boundaries interact with some pattern
  constructs can be changed. See <code>useAnchoringBounds</code>
  and <code>useTransparentBounds</code>
  for more details. 
 <p> This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
  new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
  result.  The <code>appendReplacement</code> and <code>appendTail</code>
  methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
  the result into an existing string buffer, or the more convenient <code>replaceAll</code>
  method can be used to create a string in which every
  matching subsequence in the input sequence is replaced. 
 <p> The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
  the most recent successful match.  It also includes the start and end
  indices of the input subsequence captured by each <a href="Pattern.html#cg">
 capturing group</a> in the pattern as well as a total
  count of such subsequences.  As a convenience, methods are also provided for
  returning these captured subsequences in string form. 
 <p> The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
  query any part of it before a successful match will cause an <code>IllegalStateException</code>
  to be thrown.  The explicit state of a matcher is
  recomputed by every match operation. 
 <p> The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
  well as the <i>append position</i>, which is initially zero and is updated
  by the <code>appendReplacement</code> method. 
 <p> A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its <code>reset()</code>
  method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its <code>reset(CharSequence)</code>
  method.  Resetting a
  matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
  to zero. 
 <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
  threads. </p>

/*!
 @brief Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.
 <p> This method performs the following actions: </p>
  
 <ol>
    
 <li><p> It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
    append position, and appends them to the given string buffer.  It
    stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
    that is, the character at index <code>start()</code>
 &nbsp;<tt>-</tt>&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>.  </p></li>
    
 <li><p> It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
    </p></li>
    
 <li><p> It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
    the last character matched, plus one, that is, to <code>end()</code>.
    </p></li>
  
 </ol>
  
 <p> The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
  captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of 
 <tt>$</tt><i>g</i> will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding 
 <code>group(g)</tt></code> respectively. For  <tt>$</tt><i>g</i><tt></tt>,
  the first number after the <tt>$</tt> is always treated as part of
  the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
  they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
  through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
  reference. If the second group matched the string <tt>"foo"</tt>, for
  example, then passing the replacement string <tt>"$2bar"</tt> would
  cause <tt>"foobar"</tt> to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
  sign (<tt>$</tt>) may be included as a literal in the replacement
  string by preceding it with a backslash (<tt>\$</tt>).
  
 <p> Note that backslashes (<tt>\</tt>) and dollar signs (<tt>$</tt>) in
  the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
  were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
  treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
  backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
  string. 
 <p> This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the 
 <code>appendTail</code> and <code>find</code> methods.  The
  following code, for example, writes <tt>one dog two dogs in the
  yard</tt> to the standard-output stream: </p>
  
 <blockquote>@code

  Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
  Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
  while (m.find()) {
      m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
  }
  m.appendTail(sb);
  System.out.println(sb.toString());

 @brief Sets the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.
 <p> Invoking this method with an argument of <tt>true</tt> will set this
  matcher to use <i>transparent</i> bounds. If the boolean
  argument is <tt>false</tt>, then <i>opaque</i> bounds will be used. 
 <p> Using transparent bounds, the boundaries of this
  matcher's region are transparent to lookahead, lookbehind,
  and boundary matching constructs. Those constructs can see beyond the
  boundaries of the region to see if a match is appropriate. 
 <p> Using opaque bounds, the boundaries of this matcher's
  region are opaque to lookahead, lookbehind, and boundary matching
  constructs that may try to see beyond them. Those constructs cannot
  look past the boundaries so they will fail to match anything outside
  of the region. 
 <p> By default, a matcher uses opaque bounds.
 @param value a boolean indicating whether to use opaque or transparent          regions
