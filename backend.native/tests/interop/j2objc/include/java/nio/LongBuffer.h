 @brief A long buffer.
 <p> This class defines four categories of operations upon
  long buffers: 
 <ul>
    <li><p> Absolute and relative <code><i>get</i></code> and
    <code><i>put</i></code> methods that read and write
    single longs; </p></li>
    <li><p> Relative <code><i>bulk get</i></code>
    methods that transfer contiguous sequences of longs from this buffer
    into an array; and</p></li>
    <li><p> Relative <code><i>bulk put</i></code>
    methods that transfer contiguous sequences of longs from a
    long array or some other long
    buffer into this buffer;&#32;and </p></li>
    <li><p> Methods for <code>compacting</code>, <code>duplicating</code>
 , and <code>slicing</code>
    a long buffer.  </p></li>
  
 </ul>
  
 <p> Long buffers can be created either by <code><i>allocation</i></code>
 , which allocates space for the buffer's
  content, by <code><i>wrapping</i></code> an existing
  long array  into a buffer, or by creating a 
 <a href="ByteBuffer.html#views"><i>view</i></a> of an existing byte buffer. 
 <p> Like a byte buffer, a long buffer is either <a href="ByteBuffer.html#direct">
 <i>direct</i> or <i>non-direct</i></a>.  A
  long buffer created via the <tt>wrap</tt> methods of this class will
  be non-direct.  A long buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
  be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
  a long buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the <code>isDirect</code>
  method.  </p>
  
 <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
  specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
  method invocations to be chained.
