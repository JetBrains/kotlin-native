/*!
 @brief A token representing the registration of a <code>SelectableChannel</code> with a 
 <code>Selector</code>.
 <p> A selection key is created each time a channel is registered with a
  selector.  A key remains valid until it is <i>cancelled</i> by invoking its 
 <code>cancel</code> method, by closing its channel, or by closing its
  selector.  Cancelling a key does not immediately remove it from its
  selector; it is instead added to the selector's <a href="Selector.html#ks">
 <i>cancelled-key set</i></a> for removal during the
  next selection operation.  The validity of a key may be tested by invoking
  its <code>isValid</code> method. 
 <a name="opsets">
  
 <p> A selection key contains two <i>operation sets</i> represented as
  integer values.  Each bit of an operation set denotes a category of
  selectable operations that are supported by the key's channel. 
 <ul>
    <li><p> The <i>interest set</i> determines which operation categories will
    be tested for readiness the next time one of the selector's selection
    methods is invoked.  The interest set is initialized with the value given
    when the key is created; it may later be changed via the <code>interestOps(int)</code>
  method. </p></li>
    <li><p> The <i>ready set</i> identifies the operation categories for which
    the key's channel has been detected to be ready by the key's selector.
    The ready set is initialized to zero when the key is created; it may later
    be updated by the selector during a selection operation, but it cannot be
    updated directly. </p></li>
  
 </ul>
  
 <p> That a selection key's ready set indicates that its channel is ready for
  some operation category is a hint, but not a guarantee, that an operation in
  such a category may be performed by a thread without causing the thread to
  block.  A ready set is most likely to be accurate immediately after the
  completion of a selection operation.  It is likely to be made inaccurate by
  external events and by I/O operations that are invoked upon the
  corresponding channel. 
 <p> This class defines all known operation-set bits, but precisely which
  bits are supported by a given channel depends upon the type of the channel.
  Each subclass of <code>SelectableChannel</code> defines an <code>validOps()</code>
  method which returns a set
  identifying just those operations that are supported by the channel.  An
  attempt to set or test an operation-set bit that is not supported by a key's
  channel will result in an appropriate run-time exception. 
 <p> It is often necessary to associate some application-specific data with a
  selection key, for example an object that represents the state of a
  higher-level protocol and handles readiness notifications in order to
  implement that protocol.  Selection keys therefore support the 
 <i>attachment</i> of a single arbitrary object to a key.  An object can be
  attached via the <code>attach</code> method and then later retrieved via
  the <code>attachment</code> method. 
 <p> Selection keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The
  operations of reading and writing the interest set will, in general, be
  synchronized with certain operations of the selector.  Exactly how this
  synchronization is performed is implementation-dependent: In a naive
  implementation, reading or writing the interest set may block indefinitely
  if a selection operation is already in progress; in a high-performance
  implementation, reading or writing the interest set may block briefly, if at
  all.  In any case, a selection operation will always use the interest-set
  value that was current at the moment that the operation began.  </p>
