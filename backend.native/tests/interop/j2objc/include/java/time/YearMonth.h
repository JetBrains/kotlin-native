 @brief A year-month in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as <code>2007-12</code>.
 <p>
  <code>YearMonth</code> is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
  of a year and month. Any field that can be derived from a year and month, such as
  quarter-of-year, can be obtained. 
 <p>
  This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
  For example, the value "October 2007" can be stored in a <code>YearMonth</code>.
  <p>
  The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
  in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
  system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
  For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
  However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
  to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

  This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input

  a <code>DateTimeException</code> is thrown.

 @brief Calculates the amount of time until another year-month in terms of the specified unit.
 <p>
  This calculates the amount of time between two <code>YearMonth</code>
  objects in terms of a single <code>TemporalUnit</code>.
  The start and end points are <code>this</code> and the specified year-month.
  The result will be negative if the end is before the start. The 
 <code>Temporal</code> passed to this method is converted to a 
 <code>YearMonth</code> using <code>from(TemporalAccessor)</code>.
  For example, the amount in years between two year-months can be calculated
  using <code>startYearMonth.until(endYearMonth, YEARS)</code>.
  <p>
  The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
  complete units between the two year-months.
  For example, the amount in decades between 2012-06 and 2032-05
  will only be one decade as it is one month short of two decades. 
 <p>
  There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
  The first is to invoke this method.
  The second is to use <code>TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)</code>:
  @code

    // these two lines are equivalent
    amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
    amount = MONTHS.between(start, end); 
  
@endcode
  The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable. 
 <p>
  The calculation is implemented in this method for <code>ChronoUnit</code>.
  The units <code>MONTHS</code>, <code>YEARS</code>, <code>DECADES</code>,
  <code>CENTURIES</code>, <code>MILLENNIA</code> and <code>ERAS</code> are supported.
  Other <code>ChronoUnit</code> values will throw an exception. 
 <p>
  If the unit is not a <code>ChronoUnit</code>, then the result of this method
  is obtained by invoking <code>TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)</code>
  passing <code>this</code> as the first argument and the converted input temporal
  as the second argument. 
 <p>
  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 @param endExclusive the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a <code>YearMonth</code> , not null
 @param unit the unit to measure the amount in, not null

 @brief Returns an adjusted copy of this year-month.
 <p>
  This returns a <code>YearMonth</code>, based on this one, with the year-month adjusted.
  The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
  Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made. 
 <p>
  A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
  A more complex adjuster might set the year-month to the next month that
  Halley's comet will pass the Earth.

 <code>TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)</code> method on the
  specified adjuster passing <code>this</code> as the argument.

 @brief Returns a copy of this year-month with the specified field set to a new value.
 <p>
  This returns a <code>YearMonth</code>, based on this one, with the value
  for the specified field changed.
  This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year or month.
  If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
  some other reason, an exception is thrown. 
 <p>
  If the field is a <code>ChronoField</code> then the adjustment is implemented here.
  The supported fields behave as follows: 
 <ul>
  <li><code>MONTH_OF_YEAR</code> -
   Returns a <code>YearMonth</code> with the specified month-of-year.
   The year will be unchanged. 
 <li><code>PROLEPTIC_MONTH</code> -
   Returns a <code>YearMonth</code> with the specified proleptic-month.
   This completely replaces the year and month of this object. 
 <li><code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code> -
   Returns a <code>YearMonth</code> with the specified year-of-era
   The month and era will be unchanged. 
 <li><code>YEAR</code> -
   Returns a <code>YearMonth</code> with the specified year.
   The month will be unchanged. 
 <li><code>ERA</code> -
   Returns a <code>YearMonth</code> with the specified era.
   The month and year-of-era will be unchanged. 
 </ul>
  <p>
  In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
  then a <code>DateTimeException</code> will be thrown. 
 <p>
  All other <code>ChronoField</code> instances will throw an <code>UnsupportedTemporalTypeException</code>.
  <p>
  If the field is not a <code>ChronoField</code>, then the result of this method
  is obtained by invoking <code>TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)</code>
  passing <code>this</code> as the argument. In this case, the field determines
  whether and how to adjust the instant.

  This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
