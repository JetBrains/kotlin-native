 @brief This class implements a character buffer that can be used as an Writer.
 The buffer automatically grows when data is written to the stream.  The data
  can be retrieved using toCharArray() and toString(). 
 <P>
  Note: Invoking close() on this class has no effect, and methods
  of this class can be called after the stream has closed
  without generating an IOException.
