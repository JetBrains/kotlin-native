/*!
 @brief Only the identity of the class of an Externalizable instance is
  written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility
  of the class to save and restore the contents of its instances.
 The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable
  interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete
  control over the format and contents of the stream for an object
  and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly
  coordinate with the supertype to save its state. These methods supersede
  customized implementations of writeObject and readObject methods.<br>
  Object Serialization uses the Serializable and Externalizable
  interfaces.  Object persistence mechanisms can use them as well.  Each
  object to be stored is tested for the Externalizable interface. If
  the object supports Externalizable, the writeExternal method is called. If the
  object does not support Externalizable and does implement
  Serializable, the object is saved using
  ObjectOutputStream. <br> When an Externalizable object is
  reconstructed, an instance is created using the public no-arg
  constructor, then the readExternal method called.  Serializable
  objects are restored by reading them from an ObjectInputStream.<br>
  An Externalizable instance can designate a substitution object via
  the writeReplace and readResolve methods documented in the Serializable
  interface.<br>
