# Kotlin/Native Gradle plugin

Since 1.3.40, a separate Gradle plugin for Kotlin/Native is deprecated in favor of the `kotlin-multiplatform` plugin.
This plugin provides an IDE support along with support of the new multiplatform project model introduced in Kotlin 1.3.0.
For more information see the `kotlin-muliplatform` [documentation page](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-discover-project.html).
