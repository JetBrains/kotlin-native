## Profiling the compiler

### Profiling with Async profiler

 IDEA Ultimate contains an Async sampling profiler.
 As of IDEA 2018.3 Async sampling profiler is still an experimental feature, so use Ctrl-Alt-Shift-/ on Linux,
Cmd-Alt-Shift-/ on macOS to activate it. Then start compilation in CLI with `--no-daemon` and
`-Porg.gradle.workers.max=1` flags (running Gradle task with the profiler doesn't seem to work properly) and attach
to the running process using "Run/Attach Profiler to Local Process" menu item.

 Select "K2NativeKt" or "org.jetbrains.kotlin.cli.utilities.MainKt" process.
On completion profiler will produce flame diagram which could be navigated with the mouse
(click-drag moves, wheel scales). More RAM in IDE (>4G) could be helpful when analyzing longer runs.
As Async is a sampling profiler, to get sensible coverage longer runs are important.

### Profiling with YourKit

Unlike Async profiler in IDEA, YourKit can work as an exact profiler and provide complete coverage
of all methods along with exact invocation counters.

Install the YourKit profiler for your platform from https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler.
Set AGENT variable to the JVMTI agent provided by YourKit, like

        export AGENT=/Applications/YourKit-Java-Profiler-2018.04.app/Contents/Resources/bin/mac/libyjpagent.jnilib

To profile standard library compilation:

        ./gradlew -PstdLibJvmArgs="-agentpath:$AGENT=probe_disable=*,listen=all,tracing"  dist

To profile platform libraries start build of proper target like this:

        ./gradlew -PplatformLibsJvmArgs="-agentpath:$AGENT=probe_disable=*,listen=all,tracing"  ios_arm64PlatformLibs

To profile standalone code compilation use:

        JAVA_OPTS="-agentpath:$AGENT=probe_disable=*,listen=all,tracing" ./dist/bin/konanc file.kt

Then attach to the desired application in YourKit GUI and use CPU tab to inspect CPU consuming methods.
Saving the trace may be needed for more analysis. Adjusting `-Xmx` in `$HOME/.yjp/ui.ini` could help
with the big traces.

To perform memory profiling follow the steps above, and after attachment to the running process
use "Start Object Allocation Recording" button. See https://www.yourkit.com/docs/java/help/allocations.jsp for more details.

 ## Compiler Gradle options

There are several gradle flags one can use for Konan build.

* **-Pbuild_flags** passes flags to the compiler used to build stdlib

        ./gradlew -Pbuild_flags="--disable lower_inline --print_ir" stdlib

* **-Pshims** compiles LLVM interface with tracing "shims". Allowing one 
    to trace the LLVM calls from the compiler.
    Make sure to rebuild the project.

        ./gradlew -Pshims=true dist

 ## Compiler environment variables

* **KONAN_DATA_DIR** changes `.konan` local data directory location (`$HOME/.konan` by default). Works both with cli compiler and gradle plugin

 ## Testing

To run blackbox compiler tests from JVM Kotlin use (takes time):

    ./gradlew run_external

To update the blackbox compiler tests set TeamCity build number in `gradle.properties`:

    testKotlinVersion=<build number>

and run `./gradlew update_external_tests`

* **-Pfilter** allows one to choose test files to run.

        ./gradlew -Pfilter=overflowLong.kt run_external

* **-Pprefix** allows one to choose external test directories to run. Only tests from directories with given prefix will be executed.

        ./gradlew -Pprefix=external_codegen_box_cast run_external

* **-Ptest_flags** passes flags to the compiler used to compile tests

        ./gradlew -Ptest_flags="--time" backend.native:tests:array0

* **-Ptest_target** specifies cross target for a test run. 

        ./gradlew -Ptest_target=raspberrypi backend.native:tests:array0

* **-Premote=user@host** sets remote test execution login/hostname. Good for cross compiled tests.

        ./gradlew -Premote=kotlin@111.22.33.444 backend.native:tests:run

* **-Ptest_verbose** enables printing compiler args and other helpful information during a test execution.

        ./gradlew -Ptest_verbose :backend.native:tests:mpp_optional_expectation
