# Platform libraries

## Overview

To provide access to user's native operating system services,
`Kotlin/Native` distribution includes a set of prebuilt libraries specific to
each target. We call them **Platform Libraries**.

### POSIX bindings

For all `Unix` or `Windows` based targets (including `Android` and
`iPhone`) we provide the `posix` platform lib. It contains bindings
to platform's implementation of `POSIX` standard.

To use the library just 

<div class="sample" markdown="1" theme="idea" data-highlight-only>

```kotlin
import platform.posix.*
```

</div> 

The only target for which it is not available is [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly).

Note that the content of `platform.posix` is NOT identical on
different platforms, in the same way as different `POSIX` implementations
are a little different.


### Popular native libraries

There are many more platform libraries available for host and
cross-compilation targets.  `Kotlin/Native` distribution provides access to
`OpenGL`, `zlib` and other popular native libraries on
applicable platforms.

On Apple platforms `objc` library is provided for interoperability with [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C).

Inspect the contents of `dist/klib/platform/$target` of the distribution for the details.

## Availability by default

The packages from platform libraries are available by default. No
special link flags need to be specified to use them. `Kotlin/Native`
compiler automatically detects which of the platform libraries have
been accessed and automatically links the needed libraries.

On the other hand, the platform libs in the distribution are merely
just wrappers and bindings to the native libraries.  That means the
native libraries themselves (`.so`, `.a`, `.dylib`, `.dll` etc)
should be installed on the machine.

## Examples

`Kotlin/Native` installation provides a wide spectrum of examples
demonstrating the use of platform libraries. 
See [samples](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/tree/master/samples) for details.
