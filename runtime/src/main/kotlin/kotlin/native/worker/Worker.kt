 *      Workers: theory of operations.
 *
 *  Worker represent asynchronous and concurrent computation, usually performed by other threads
 * in the same process. Object passing between workers is performed using transfer operation, so that
 * object graph belongs to one worker at the time, but can be disconnected and reconnected as needed.
 * See 'Object Transfer Basics' below for more details on how objects shall be transferred.
 * This approach ensures that no concurrent access happens to same object, while data may flow between
 * workers as needed.
