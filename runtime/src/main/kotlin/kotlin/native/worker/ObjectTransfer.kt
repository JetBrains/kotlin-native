/**
 *  Object Transfer Basics.
 *
 *  Objects can be passed between threads in one of two possible modes.
 *
 *    - CHECKED - object subgraph is checked to be not reachable by other globals or locals, and passed
 *      if so, otherwise an exception is thrown
 *    - UNCHECKED - object is blindly passed to another worker, if there are references
 *      left in the passing worker - it may lead to crash or program malfunction
 *
 *   Checked mode checks if object is no longer used in passing worker, using memory-management
 *  specific algorithm (ARC implementation relies on trial deletion on object graph rooted in
 *  passed object), and throws IllegalStateException if object graph rooted in transferred object
 *  is reachable by some other means,
 *
 *   Unchecked mode, intended for most performance crititcal operations, where object graph ownership
 *  is expected to be correct (such as application debugged earlier in CHECKED mode), just transfers
 *  ownership without further checks.
 *
 *   Note, that for some cases cycle collection need to be done to ensure that dead cycles do not affect
 *  reachability of passed object graph. See `konan.internal.GC.collect()`.
 *
