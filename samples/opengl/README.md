# OpenGL application

 This example shows interaction with OpenGL library, to render classical 3D test model. Linux build requires `apt-get install freeglut3-dev` or similar,
MacOS shall work as is.

To build use `../gradlew build` or `./build.sh`.

To run use `../gradlew run`

Alternatively you can run artifact directly 
 
    ./build/konan/bin/OpenGlTeapot${target}/OpenGlTeapot${target}.kexe

It will render 3D model of teapot. Feel free to experiment with it, the whole power of OpenGL
is at your hands.
