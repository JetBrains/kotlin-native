# watchOS sample

This example shows how to write watchOS UI applications in Kotlin, and run them on
iWatch or simulator.

To build and run the sample do the following:

1.  Fix bundleIdPrefix and DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml and generate XCode project
    with xcodegen (https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/).

2.  Open generated `watchosSample.xcodeproj` with Xcode.

3.  Now build and run the application on a connected iPhone with Xcode or simulator.

Note that in this example we do not use storyboards, and instead create user interface
components programmatically.
