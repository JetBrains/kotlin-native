# iOS UIKit sample

This example shows how to write iOS UI applications in Kotlin, and run them on
Apple devices, such as an iPhone.

To build and run the sample do the following:

1.  Fix bundleIdPrefix and DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml and generate XCode project
    with xcodegen (https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/).

2.  Open generated `UIKitSample.xcodeproj` with Xcode.

3.  Now build and run the application on a connected iPhone with Xcode or simulator.

Note that in this example we do not use storyboards, and instead create user interface
components programmatically.
