## Making release of Kotlin/Native ##

### Move version up in the repository ###

   * Increment `konanVersion` in topmost `gradle.properties`.
   * Create entry for new release in CHANGELOG.md file (consult git history for features included)
   * Update RELEASE_NOTES.md with actual information on the released bits

### Create tagged release branch ###

    git checkout -b v0.X-fixes
    git tag -a v0.X -m "version 0.X"
    git push --set-upstream origin v0.X-fixes --tags

### Build for all supported platforms ###

Repeat those steps for Mac OS X, Linux x86-64 and Windows x64 machines/VMs:

    git pull
    git checkout -b v0.X-fixes origin/v0.X-fixes
    ./gradlew clean bundle

Make sure all samples are buildable from the bundle with both Gradle and shell script builds.

### Create GitHub release ###

 Create release at [`GitHub release page`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/releases).
We usually mark 0.X releases as pre-releases.

 Upload builds created on the previous step to the GitHub release page.
